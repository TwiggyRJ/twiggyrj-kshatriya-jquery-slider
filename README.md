# twiggyrj-kshatriya-jquery-slider
This is a basic carousel slider that was built in a day as a learning exercise to get better at JavaScript, jQuery and learn a bit of ES6.

This slider takes the following items when initialised:


Option | Expected Value | What it is used for
el | Carousel as an jQuery Object | Used to select the carousel item
sliderTrack | Carousel slider track as an jQuery Object | Used to select the carousel track
next | The element that will act as the next button | Will have an event bound to it
prev | The element that will act as the back button | Will have an event bound to it
